#  Milk Adulteration Detection using Vision Transformers

**Duration:** 2024  
**Domain:** Computer Vision • Machine Learning • Food Quality Analysis  

---

## Overview
This project focuses on **detecting adulteration in milk samples** using **RGB image-based classification**.  
We created a custom dataset of refracted milk images and trained a **Swin Transformer** (Vision Transformer variant) to distinguish between **adulterated** and **non-adulterated** samples with high accuracy.

##  Features
-  **Custom Dataset**: 3,246 RGB images of refracted milk samples.  
-  **Adulteration Detection**: Binary classification (Adulterated vs. Non-adulterated).  
-  **Vision Transformer (Swin)**: Advanced attention-based feature extraction.  
-  **High Accuracy**: Effective performance on real-world sample variations.  
-  **Scalable Approach**: Can be extended to other liquid quality assessments.
